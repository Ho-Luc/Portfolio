USER STORIES

As a developer:
- I want my site to use valid semantic markup, so employers love me.
- I want my portfolio items displayed with a repeatable template, so I can reuse it and abstract our details for individual projects.

As a Creator:
- I want my site to be linked up to my social and github pages.
